I keep copying configs from across the internet; munging them; fashioning them as per my requirements.
You know cannibalizing the configurations.

This is a stab at writing neovim configuration using [fennel](https://fennel-lang.org/). This is heaviliy inspired (cannibalizes) the awesome [Magic-Kit](https://github.com/Olical/magic-kit) by [Olical](https://github.com/Olical/)
