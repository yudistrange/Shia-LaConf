> Actual cannibal Shia LaConf

Copied configs from across the internet. They have been munged and fashined as required.
[_Cannibalized_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0u4M6vppCI) in a sense.

This is a stab at writing neovim configuration using [fennel](https://fennel-lang.org/). This was initially inspired (cannibalizes) by the awesome [Magic-Kit](https://github.com/Olical/magic-kit) by [Olical](https://github.com/Olical/). However now it has been written from the ground up in fennel.

## Installation
```
git clone git@github.com:yudistrange/Shia-LaConf.git ~/.config/nvim
~/.config/nvim/script/sync.sh
```
